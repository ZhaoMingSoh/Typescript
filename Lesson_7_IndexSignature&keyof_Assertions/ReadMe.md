# When and how to use the keyof keyword in TypeScript ?

1. Primary use is to dynamically acess object properties, particularly when iterating through the keys of an object using the for..in loop.
2. Enforces type safety by making the ensuring that the accessed properties are valid according to the specified type/interface as such reduces the risk of runtime errors caused by accessing mismatched properties.
3. Frequently used in mapped types to create new types that are based on existing types. [needs more context]
4. Often used in utility functions and generic code to work with object properties in a generic way. [needs more explanation]
